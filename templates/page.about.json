Having five graduate gemologists from the Gemological Institute of America on staff gives us an edge in selecting the best diamonds and gemstones available.<\/p><p>In order to deliver that level of quality, we elected to partner with De Beers Forevermark, a DeBeers family of companies. The unique inscription on every De Beers Forevermark diamond is a promise of beauty, rarity, and ethical sourcing. Less than 1% of the diamonds found from select mines across the world qualify to become a De Beers  Forevermark diamond.<\/p><p>We also proudly feature Hearts on Fire, the world’s most perfectly cut diamond. Their consistency of excellence in diamond cutting is unparalleled in today’s market. No other brand features exclusively ideal cut diamonds, regardless of size, in every piece of jewelry they offer.<\/p><p>For over 24 years our dedication to increasing value and obsession with technology helped us discover a unique faceting orientation that delivers more sparkle than traditionally cut diamonds. We call this diamond the Marks 89Ⓡ. With a proprietary faceting arrangement, 89 facets to be exact, any Marks 89Ⓡ diamond regardless of quality will out-sparkle it’s 57 faceted cousins.<\/p><p>Most recently we became the only jeweler in our region to offer lab-grown diamonds produced by ALTR. This gives us the ability to offer a diamond identical to earth-mined diamonds that are truly eco-friendly, sustainable, and socially responsible. This new technology affords you get more diamond for your budget.<\/p>",
