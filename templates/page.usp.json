With over 35 years of experience in diamonds and jewelry, we found the success of our business lies in focusing on the important thing - our relationship with our customers. We look at it like any successful relationship. Your job is to take care of your partner through the good and bad; we are here to take care of your ring through the good and the bad. Your ring will be cared for and serviced under our roof by our master jewelers.<\/p><p><strong>Your love knows no bounds - why should your ring be bound by the limitations of a manufacturers warranty?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Nationwide Normal Wear Guarantee:<\/strong><br\/>We believe jewelry is meant to be worn, not admired from afar (okay, we believe it should be admired from near and far, but definitely while it is being proudly worn!).<\/p><p>IN OUR DESIRE FOR YOU TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR JEWELRY, WE TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EFFECTS OF EVERYDAY WEAR. THIS INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO:<\/p><p>Polishing and refinishing for scratches(or rhodium plating for white gold)Repairing or rebuilding prongsTightening of center and side stonesReplacement of any diamond 0.20ct or smaller<\/p><p><a>Nationwide Lifetime Sizing Guarantee:<\/a><br\/>Life happens! Beautiful things like children happen.<br\/>Not so beautiful things like accidents or arthritis also happen. Just like your promise to your partner, we are here for you through the good and the bad. We will re-size your ring at no cost should it require an adjustment within safe guidelines (most rings can be sized up 2 sizes and down 1 size safely). We look at each ring on a case by case basis to determine what we can safely guarantee.<\/p><p>We are proud to extend our warranty through our partnership with Preferred Jewelers International, a group of over 200 independent jewelers across North America who can service your ring for you at any time. Your purchase with us guarantees your place in this network of jewelers at no additional cost where your Marks Bridal Warranty will be honored exactly as it is described here.
